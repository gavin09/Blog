Sometimes, I want to find some commands I typed before. 
Or remind what I did last time in terminal. 

So, I start to survey this issue. 
Both of the discussions are interesting and useful [macworld.com][1] [linux.byexamples.com][2]. 

I borrow the ideas from both of the website. And write a script 

share here https://gist.github.com/
